# LDAP authentication plug-in for StackStorm Community edition

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/StackStorm/st2-auth-backend-ldap.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/StackStorm/st2-auth-backend-ldap) [![IRC](https://img.shields.io/irc/%23stackstorm.png)](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=stackstorm)

The LDAP backend reads credentials and authenticates users against an LDAP server. This backend was originally contributed to the st2 repo by [Ruslan Tumarkin](https://github.com/ruslantum) under [PR #1790](https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/pull/1790).

#### Note:
There are currently two types of LDAP backends available - community contributed one and one developed and maintained by the StackStorm team. This repository contains the community contributed one.

Community contributed backend can be installed by anyone and the StackStorm developed one is only available in the enterprise edition (for more information on the enterprise edition, please see https://stackstorm.com/product/#enterprise).

The difference between them is that the one included in the enterprise edition is developed, supported, tested, maintained and certified by the StackStorm team and the community contributed one is developed and maintained by the community.

### Configuration Options

| `chase_referrals` | no       |  True   | Boolean parameter to set whether to chase referrals. |

#### LDAP x509 certificate validation policy (cert_policy)
| value        | resulting behaviour |

| `demand` (**default**) | no certificate provided: _authentication stops_ <br> bad certificate provided: _authentication stops_ |
| `hard`                 | no certificate provided: _authentication stops_ <br>   bad certificate provided: _authentication stops_ |
| `try`                  | no certificate provided: _authentication continues_ <br>  bad certificate provided: _authentication stops_ |
| `allow`                | no certificate provided: _authentication continues_ <br> bad certificate provided: _authentication continues_ |
| `never`                | no certificate is requested: _authentication continues_ |

### Configuration Example

Please refer to the authentication section in the StackStorm [documentation](http://docs.stackstorm.com) for basic setup concept. The following is an example of the auth section in the StackStorm configuration file for the ldap backend.

```
[auth]
mode = standalone
backend = ldap
backend_kwargs = { "ldap_uri": "ldap://ldap.example.com", "use_tls": true, "cert_policy": "demand", "bind_dn": "cn=user,dc=example,dc=com", "bind_pw": "bind_password", "user": {"base_dn": "ou=users,dc=example,dc=com", "search_filter": "(uid={username})", "scope": "onelevel"}, "group": {"base_dn": "ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com", "search_filter": "(&(cn=st2access)(memberUid={username}))", "scope": "subtree"} }
enable = True
use_ssl = True
cert = /path/to/ssl/cert/file
key = /path/to/ssl/key/file
logging = /path/to/st2auth.logging.conf
api_url = https://myhost.example.com:9101
debug = False
```

### Authenticating users against various schemas.

There is no one standard way to store user credentials in LDAP.  There are various ways to organise the directory tree and various ways to secure it.  In some cases, the users DN can't be determined with a static configuration and requires a bind DN to locate the user in the database before user authentication can occur.

This authentication backend attempts to be flexible with the way LDAP binding and authentication can be performed, but may not meet all use cases.

#### Active Directory Examples

Using `sAMAccountName` should be unique in combination with a domain name.
`"bind_dn": "sAMAccountName={username}@example.com", "bind_pw": "{password}"`

Using `userPrincipalName` should be unique within a forest.
`"bind_dn": "userPrincipalName={username}", "bind_pw": "{password}"`

#### OpenLDAP Examples

Using anonymous binding
`"bind_dn": "", "bind_pw": ""`

Using bind DN
`"bind_dn": "cn=bind_user,dc=example,dc=com", "bind_pw": "bind_user_password"`
